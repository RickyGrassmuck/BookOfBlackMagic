# BookOfBlackMagic
A compilation of misc. scripts I've written/use for my Plex system. Thought I may as well post them on github. Maybe someone else would find some of them useful as well. :)


# magicbullet.py
Currently just modifies plex server settings. However, it sets a hidden magical undocumented setting which forces all clients to use auto quality. Pretty much the closest/only option to set playback quality using the plex server :)
